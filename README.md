# Infinite Tic-Tac-Toe

A mobile game made in Godot.

## How to play

It's basically tic-tac-toe, but with a twist. There can only be 3 figures of each type at the same time. When the limit is reached, the oldest placed figure starts to blink.
On the next press it's removed from the board and inserts a new one.
